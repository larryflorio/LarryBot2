## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Callback registration system to `CommandRegistry` with support for callback metadata, validation, and plugin-based callback routing.
- `callback_handler` decorator for registering callback handlers with metadata.
- Centralized narrative task callback handler in `larrybot.plugins.tasks` using the new callback registration system.
- Comprehensive callback handlers for client plugin: `client_view`, `client_edit`, `client_delete`, `client_analytics`, `client_add`, `client_refresh`.
- Comprehensive callback handlers for habit plugin: `habit_done`, `habit_progress`, `habit_delete`, `habit_add`, `habit_stats`, `habit_refresh`.
- Calendar refresh callback handler in `larrybot.plugins.calendar` using the new registry-based system.
- Performance plugin callback handlers: `perf_refresh`, `perf_dashboard`, `perf_details`, `perf_alerts`, `perf_alerts_refresh`, `perf_trends`, `perf_clear`, `perf_export`.
- Comprehensive test suite for performance callback handlers with 11 test cases covering success and error scenarios.

### Changed
- `/addtask` narrative flow now uses plugin-owned callback handler registered via `CommandRegistry.register_callback`, improving modularity and maintainability.
- `TelegramBotHandler` now delegates callback queries to the registry before falling back to legacy handlers.
- Client plugin callbacks now use registry-based routing with plugin-owned handlers.
- Habit plugin callbacks now use registry-based routing with plugin-owned handlers.
- Calendar plugin callbacks now use registry-based routing with plugin-owned handlers.
- Performance plugin callbacks now use registry-based routing with plugin-owned handlers, replacing internal `handle_callback_query` method.
- Updated tests to reflect new callback routing patterns and removed references to hardcoded callback handlers.

### Removed
- Hardcoded callback handlers from `TelegramBotHandler` for client, habit, calendar, and performance plugins.
- Internal `handle_callback_query` method from `PerformancePlugin` class.
- Direct plugin callback handling dependencies in bot handler.

### Architecture
- **Plugin-Owned Callbacks**: All callback handlers now owned by their respective plugins, improving separation of concerns.
- **Registry-Based Routing**: Centralized callback routing through `CommandRegistry` with metadata and validation.
- **Standardized Pattern**: Consistent callback registration and handling pattern across all plugins.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Adding new callbacks now requires only plugin-level changes, not bot handler modifications.
- **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and user feedback for all callback operations.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for callback registration, routing, and plugin-specific functionality.

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing command interfaces.
- **Internal Only**: Changes are internal to the callback routing system and don't affect user-facing functionality.

### Migration Complete
- **Phase 1**: Core callback registration system and narrative task flow migration ✅
- **Phase 2**: Client, habit, calendar, and performance plugin migrations ✅
- **Total Callbacks Migrated**: 20+ callback patterns across 5 plugins

- **Tasks Plugin**: Narrative task callbacks already migrated in previous phase.
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved, only internal routing changed.

### Testing
- All callback registration tests pass (8/8).
- Narrative task creation tests pass.
- Bot handler callback routing tests pass.
- Comprehensive test coverage for new callback system.

### Performance
- Reduced coupling between bot handler and plugins.
