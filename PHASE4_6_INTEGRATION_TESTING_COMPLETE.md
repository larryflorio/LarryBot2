## Key Fixes Applied

### Task Service Integration Fix
- **Issue:** Test was calling non-existent `get_task_by_id` and `complete_task` methods on TaskService
- **Solution:** Updated test to use repository methods directly:
  - `task_repo.get_task_by_id()` for task retrieval
  - `task_repo.update_status()` for task completion
- **Result:** Test now passes and properly validates service-repository integration
