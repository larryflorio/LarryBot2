## Plugin System Details

### Active Plugins (10)
1. **advanced_tasks.py** - Enhanced task features
2. **calendar.py** - Google Calendar integration (91% coverage)
3. **client.py** - Client management
4. **file_attachments.py** - File upload/download (91% coverage)
5. **habit.py** - Habit tracking (94% coverage)
6. **health.py** - System health monitoring
7. **hello.py** - Example plugin
8. **reminder.py** - Reminder system (89% coverage)
9. **tasks.py** - Core task management
10. **example_enhanced.py** - Advanced example plugin

### Plugin Architecture Patterns
- **Registration**: Decorator-based command registration
- **Event Integration**: All plugins use event-driven communication
- **Dependency Injection**: Service container integration
- **Error Isolation**: Plugin failures don't affect core system

## Command Consolidation Results

### Successfully Consolidated Commands
- `/add` + `/addtask` → Enhanced `/add` (progressive complexity)
- `/list` + `/tasks` → Enhanced `/list` (optional filtering)
- `/search` + `/search_advanced` → Enhanced `/search` (flag-based modes)
- `/analytics` family → Unified `/analytics` (complexity parameters)
- Time tracking namespace conflict resolved

### Deprecation Handlers (7 implemented)
- Seamless backward compatibility maintained
- User guidance to new command patterns
- Zero breaking changes for existing users

## Current Performance Benchmarks

### Response Times
- **Cached Operations**: < 1ms (446x improvement)
- **Basic Commands**: < 100ms average
- **Complex Operations**: < 300ms (bulk operations)
- **Analytics**: Immediate response (background processing)
- **File Operations**: < 1s for uploads/downloads

### Memory Usage
- **20-30% reduction** through session optimization
- **Database Sessions**: Max 2s duration with tracking
- **Cache Memory**: LRU eviction with TTL management
- **Background Workers**: 4 threads for parallel processing

## Known Issues & Areas for Investigation

### Test Issues
- 1 failing test in factories module (warning about unknown pytest.mark.performance)
- 23% coverage gap needs analysis for critical path prioritization

### Potential Technical Debt Areas
- Some legacy code patterns in older plugin files
- Database query optimization opportunities in high-frequency operations
- AsyncIO task lifecycle could benefit from additional monitoring
- Type hint coverage could be improved in utility modules

## Recent Major Changes (June-July 2025)
