```markdown
## 📊 Statistics Verification

All statistics in this document are automatically verified against the codebase:

- **Test Count**: `python -m pytest --collect-only -q`
- **Coverage**: `python -m pytest --cov=larrybot --cov-report=term`
- **Commands**: `python test_commands.py`
- **Plugins**: `ls larrybot/plugins/*.py | grep -v __init__ | wc -l`

**Last verified**: July 2, 2025
```

### **2. Automated Verification Script**
**Created: `scripts/verify_documentation_accuracy.py`**
- Comprehensive script to verify all documentation statistics
- Checks test counts, coverage, commands, and plugins
- Provides detailed error reporting for accuracy issues
- Can be run before any documentation updates

### **3. Updated Timestamps**
**All major documentation files updated with current date:**
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated to July 2, 2025
- ✅ `docs/project/current-state.md` - Updated to July 2, 2025
- ✅ `docs/project/coverage-analysis.md` - Updated to July 2, 2025
