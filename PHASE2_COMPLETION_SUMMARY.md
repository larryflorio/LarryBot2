### **Performance Monitoring System**
```python
# Advanced operation tracking
with performance_collector.track_operation("complex_operation", {"context": "data"}):
    # Your operation here
    pass

# Comprehensive dashboard data
dashboard = performance_collector.get_performance_dashboard()
# Returns: summary, operations, system, alerts, trends, top_operations

# Performance decorators
@track_performance("service_operation", {"service": "TaskService"})
async def enhanced_service_method(self, data):
    # Automatic performance tracking
    return result
```

### **Enhanced Enum System**
```python
# Comprehensive enum functionality
status = TaskStatus.TODO
print(f"Status: {status} - Color: {status.color_code}")
print(f"Can transition to: {[s.value for s in status.can_transition_to]}")
print(f"Is active: {status.is_active}")

# Priority with business logic
priority = TaskPriority.CRITICAL
print(f"Priority weight: {priority.weight}")
print(f"SLA hours: {priority.sla_hours}")
print(f"Description: {priority.description}")

# Validation and conversion
validated_status = validate_enum_value(TaskStatus, "in progress", "status")
# Returns: TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS
```

### **Enhanced Task Model**
```python
# Create task with enum validation
task = Task(
    description="Enhanced task",
    status="In Progress",  # Auto-converted to TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS
    priority="HIGH",       # Auto-converted to TaskPriority.HIGH
    estimated_hours=8.0
)

# Advanced properties
print(f"Priority score: {task.calculate_priority_score()}")
print(f"SLA remaining: {task.sla_hours_remaining} hours")
print(f"Is overdue: {task.is_overdue}")

# Status transitions with validation
success = task.transition_to_status(TaskStatus.DONE)
print(f"Transition successful: {success}")
```
