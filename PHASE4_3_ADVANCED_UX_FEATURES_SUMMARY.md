- **Filter Defaults**: Context-aware filter suggestions
- **User Pattern Learning**: Adapts defaults based on user preferences

#### Capabilities:
```python
# Task defaults
defaults = IntelligentDefaultsHelper.suggest_task_defaults(
    "Urgent work meeting tomorrow", user_context, task_history
)

# Habit defaults
habit_defaults = IntelligentDefaultsHelper.suggest_habit_defaults(
    "Exercise every day in the morning"
)

# Reminder defaults
reminder_defaults = IntelligentDefaultsHelper.suggest_reminder_defaults(
    task_data, user_preferences
)
```

#### Smart Detection:
- **Priority**: Detects urgent, high, medium, low priority keywords
- **Categories**: Work, Personal, Health, Learning, Finance, Shopping, Travel
- **Due Dates**: Today, tomorrow, next week, this week, next month, end of month

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery System üõ†Ô∏è

**Enhanced Class:** `ErrorRecoveryHelper`

#### Features:
- **Context-Aware Error Recovery**: Different recovery options based on error type and context
- **Enhanced Help Messages**: Detailed, actionable help with examples
- **User-Level Specific Guidance**: Different help for beginners vs experts
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Suggests alternative approaches when operations fail

#### Error Types Supported:
- **Validation Errors**: Input format issues with examples
- **Not Found Errors**: Search and creation alternatives
- **Permission Errors**: Authentication and authorization help
- **Network Errors**: Connection troubleshooting steps
- **Database Errors**: Storage and system status options
- **Timeout Errors**: Performance optimization suggestions

#### Enhanced Help Features:
```python
# Contextual help with examples
help_message = ErrorRecoveryHelper.provide_contextual_help({
    'type': 'validation_error',
    'message': 'Invalid task description',
    'user_level': 'beginner',
    'action': 'add_task'
})

# Recovery keyboard with context-specific actions
keyboard = ErrorRecoveryHelper.build_error_recovery_keyboard(
    'validation_error', context
)
```

### 5. Integration Features üîó

#### Smart Integration:
- **Smart Suggestions + Defaults**: Suggestions work with intelligent defaults
- **Progressive Disclosure + Suggestions**: Disclosure levels adapt to task complexity
