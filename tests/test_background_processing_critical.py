"""
Critical Background Processing Tests

This test suite ensures the reliability of the background job processing system,
focusing on:
1. Job lifecycle management (submit, execute, complete, fail)  
2. Worker pool reliability (start/stop, crash recovery)
3. Queue overflow handling (capacity limits, backpressure)
4. Error recovery (job failures, timeout handling)
5. Memory management (cleanup, resource leaks)
6. Concurrency safety (thread safety, race conditions)

These tests protect critical system operations like analytics, bulk operations,
and report generation that run in the background.
