## 1. Inline Keyboards & Reply Markup ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Added inline keyboards** to all major bot responses (tasks, clients, habits, reminders).
- **✅ Quick actions**: Buttons for "Done," "Edit," "Delete," "Remind Me," etc., directly under each item.
- **✅ Navigation**: "Next/Prev" for paginated lists, "Back" to main menu, etc.
- **✅ Callback queries**: Handle button presses without requiring new commands.

**Example:**
```python
from telegram import InlineKeyboardButton, InlineKeyboardMarkup

def build_task_keyboard(task_id):
    return InlineKeyboardMarkup([
        [
            InlineKeyboardButton("✅ Done", callback_data=f"done:{task_id}"),
            InlineKeyboardButton("✏️ Edit", callback_data=f"edit:{task_id}"),
            InlineKeyboardButton("🗑️ Delete", callback_data=f"delete:{task_id}")
        ]
    ])
```

---

## 2. Rich Message Formatting ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Use MarkdownV2** for bold, italic, code, and links in all bot responses.
- **✅ Visual cues**: Emojis for status, priorities, and categories.
- **✅ Sectioned messages**: Group tasks by status, priority, or client with clear headers.
- **✅ Consistent formatting**: Standardize how lists, errors, and analytics are displayed.

---

## 3. Contextual Menus & Dynamic Actions ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Show only relevant actions** for each entity (e.g., only "Mark as Done" for incomplete tasks).
- **✅ Dynamic menus**: Adjust available buttons based on task status, user context, etc.
- **✅ Callback query handlers**: Centralize logic for button actions.

---

## 4. User-Friendly Error and Help Messages ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Clear, actionable error messages** with suggestions for correction.
- **✅ Inline help**: Add "?" buttons or inline help for command usage.
- **✅ Guided flows**: Prompt users for missing arguments or invalid input.

---

## 5. Progressive Disclosure ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Show summaries first** (e.g., "3 tasks due today"), with buttons to expand for details.
- **✅ Collapsible lists**: Only show details when requested.
- **✅ Paginated responses**: For long lists, use "Next/Prev" buttons.

---

## 6. Input Validation and Guidance ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Prompt for missing or invalid arguments** instead of failing silently.
- **✅ Suggest corrections** for typos or invalid input.
- **✅ Auto-complete or quick-pick options** where possible (e.g., categories, clients).

---

## 7. Enhanced Analytics and Summaries ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Visual summaries**: Use emojis, progress bars, or charts (as text/emoji) for analytics.
- **✅ Quick stats**: Show key metrics at the top of lists or dashboards.

---

## 8. Accessibility and Internationalization ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Accessible formatting**: Ensure all users can read and interact with messages.
- **✅ Future-proof for localization**: Structure messages for easy translation.

3. Each task is shown with an inline keyboard:
   - ✅ Done | ✏️ Edit | 🗑️ Delete
4. User taps "✅ Done" → Bot marks task as done and updates the message.
5. User taps "✏️ Edit" → Bot prompts for new description.
6. User taps "🗑️ Delete" → Bot asks for confirmation, then deletes.
