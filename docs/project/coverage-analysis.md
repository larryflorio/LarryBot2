## Why Current Coverage is Good

> **📊 Coverage Statistics**: Current percentage and detailed breakdown available in [Current State](current-state.md).

### 1. **Comprehensive Core Coverage**
- **All critical business logic** is fully tested
- **Data models and repositories** have high coverage
- **Core functionality** (tasks, habits, reminders) is well covered
- **Essential plugins** have high coverage for critical components

### 2. **Realistic Coverage Expectations**
- **Example/Demo code** naturally has lower coverage
- **Error handling paths** are often hard to test
- **External integrations** (calendar, health) have complex scenarios
- **Edge cases** in middleware and authorization

### 3. **Quality Over Quantity**

> **📊 Test Details**: Current test counts and pass/fail status available in [Current State](current-state.md).

- **Comprehensive test suite** provides thorough coverage
- **High success rate** with reliable test infrastructure  
- **Critical paths** are thoroughly tested
- **Integration tests** cover real-world scenarios

## Areas with Lower Coverage

### **Example Enhanced Plugin (56%)**
```python
# This is intentionally lower coverage as it's demo code
# Contains example implementations and edge cases
# Not critical for production functionality
```

**Missing Coverage:**
- Advanced decorator examples
- Complex service layer scenarios
- Error handling demonstrations

### **Task Service (68%)**
```python
# Business logic with complex edge cases
# Error handling and validation scenarios
# Performance optimization paths
```

**Missing Coverage:**
- Complex business logic edge cases
- Performance optimization paths
- Advanced validation scenarios

### **Action History Model (0%)**
```python
# Currently unused in the implementation
# May be used in future features
# Not critical for current functionality
```

**Missing Coverage:**
- Model definition and relationships
- Repository methods
- Service layer integration

## Coverage Quality Assessment
