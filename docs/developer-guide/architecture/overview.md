2. **Command Handler** emits event → Event Bus
3. **Event Bus** notifies relevant plugins/services
4. **Services** perform business logic, check cache, submit background jobs if needed
5. **Repositories** use cached data or query database via optimized sessions
6. **Background Queue** processes heavy operations (analytics, etc.) in parallel
7. **Performance Monitor** tracks all operations and alerts on slow performance
8. **Results** delivered immediately (cached) or via background processing

## 🛠️ Extensibility
- **Add new plugins**: Register with the event bus
- **Add new commands**: Implement and register command handler with caching support

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline

LarryBot integrates advanced NLP features to enhance user experience and productivity. The NLP pipeline is modular, fully backward compatible, and designed for local, privacy-preserving operation.

### Features
- **Intent Recognition:** Detects user intent (e.g., create task, set reminder) using spaCy and rule-based logic.
- **Entity Extraction:** Extracts dates, times, task names, and named entities using spaCy NER and dateparser.
    - The extracted entities dictionary always includes a 'date' key if any date is found, containing the most relevant/first date (from either method).
    - The 'all_dates' key contains a list of all found dates (ISO format).
    - This unification ensures consistent access for all downstream code and tests.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes user sentiment using a lightweight, rule-based approach.

### Configuration
- NLP is controlled via environment variables in `.env` or system environment:
  - `NLP_ENABLED` (default: true)
  - `NLP_MODEL` (default: 'en_core_web_sm')

### Extension Points
- To add new intents or entities, extend the respective NLP class in `larrybot/nlp/`.
- To swap NLP models, update the `NLP_MODEL` config.

### Developer Notes
- NLP results are stored in `context.user_data` during message handling for downstream use.
- All NLP features are strictly additive and backward compatible.

### [2025-07-02] NLP Entity Extraction Update
- Date extraction is now unified: the 'date' key is always present if any date is found (from either dateparser or spaCy NER), and 'all_dates' contains all found dates. This ensures consistent, backward-compatible access to date entities for all downstream consumers and tests.

## 🕒 Timezone and Datetime Handling

LarryBot2 uses a centralized timezone management system for all time-sensitive features. The `TimeZoneService` (larrybot/core/timezone.py) and `datetime_utils` (larrybot/utils/datetime_utils.py) modules provide robust, maintainable, and consistent timezone handling across the codebase.

- **UTC Storage**: All datetimes are stored in UTC in the database for consistency and reliability.
- **Local Display**: All times shown to users are transparently converted to and from the user's configured/system timezone.
- **Automatic Detection**: The system detects the local timezone at startup, with manual override and fallback to UTC.
- **DST Handling**: Daylight Saving Time is handled automatically.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always use the provided timezone utilities for all datetime operations in plugins and integrations.
  - All datetime comparisons, filtering, and analytics should use the timezone-aware utilities.
  - Never use naive datetime operations or direct datetime.now()/utcnow() in business logic.
