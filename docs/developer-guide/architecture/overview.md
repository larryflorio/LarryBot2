# Architecture Overview 🏗️

LarryBot2 is designed with modularity, extensibility, and high performance in mind. This overview covers the main architectural principles and components for developers who want to understand, extend, or contribute to the system.

## 🧩 Key Principles
- **Modular Design**: Each feature is a separate module or plugin.
- **Event-Driven**: Core communication via an event bus.
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected for loose coupling.
- **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable codebase.
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted and testable.
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching, background processing, and session optimization.

## 🏛️ Main Components
- **Command Handlers**: Process Telegram commands and user input with loading indicators.
- **Event Bus**: Dispatches events between core and plugins.
- **Plugins**: Extend functionality (tasks, calendar, analytics, etc.).
- **Services**: Business logic (task, client, calendar, health, etc.).
- **Repositories**: Data access and persistence (ORM-backed with intelligent caching).
- **Models**: Data structures for tasks, clients, reminders, etc.
- **Scheduler**: Handles reminders and scheduled tasks with performance optimization.
- **Config Loader**: Loads and validates environment/configuration.
- **Query Cache System**: High-performance caching layer with TTL management.
- **Background Job Queue**: 4-worker parallel processing for heavy operations.
- **Session Manager**: Optimized database session lifecycle with tracking.
- **Performance Monitor**: Real-time metrics and automatic alerting.

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. **User sends command** via Telegram → Command Handler (with immediate loading indicator)
2. **Command Handler** emits event → Event Bus
3. **Event Bus** notifies relevant plugins/services
4. **Services** perform business logic, check cache, submit background jobs if needed
5. **Repositories** use cached data or query database via optimized sessions
6. **Background Queue** processes heavy operations (analytics, etc.) in parallel
7. **Performance Monitor** tracks all operations and alerts on slow performance
8. **Results** delivered immediately (cached) or via background processing

## 🛠️ Extensibility
- **Add new plugins**: Register with the event bus
- **Add new commands**: Implement and register command handler with caching support
- **Add new services**: Inject via dependency injection with background processing
- **Add new models**: Update repositories and services with cache invalidation

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline

LarryBot integrates advanced NLP features to enhance user experience and productivity. The NLP pipeline is modular, fully backward compatible, and designed for local, privacy-preserving operation.

### Features
- **Intent Recognition:** Detects user intent (e.g., create task, set reminder) using spaCy and rule-based logic.
- **Entity Extraction:** Extracts dates, times, task names, and named entities using spaCy NER and dateparser.
    - The extracted entities dictionary always includes a 'date' key if any date is found, containing the most relevant/first date (from either method).
    - The 'all_dates' key contains a list of all found dates (ISO format).
    - This unification ensures consistent access for all downstream code and tests.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes user sentiment using a lightweight, rule-based approach.

### Configuration
- NLP is controlled via environment variables in `.env` or system environment:
  - `NLP_ENABLED` (default: true)
  - `NLP_MODEL` (default: 'en_core_web_sm')

### Extension Points
- To add new intents or entities, extend the respective NLP class in `larrybot/nlp/`.
- To swap NLP models, update the `NLP_MODEL` config.

### Developer Notes
- NLP results are stored in `context.user_data` during message handling for downstream use.
- All NLP features are strictly additive and backward compatible.

### [2025-07-02] NLP Entity Extraction Update
- Date extraction is now unified: the 'date' key is always present if any date is found (from either dateparser or spaCy NER), and 'all_dates' contains all found dates. This ensures consistent, backward-compatible access to date entities for all downstream consumers and tests.

## 🕒 Timezone and Datetime Handling

LarryBot2 uses a **centralized, timezone-safe datetime system** for all time-sensitive features. The system is designed to prevent timezone-related bugs and ensure consistent behavior across all operations.

### **Core Components**
- **`larrybot/utils/basic_datetime.py`** - Core datetime utilities with no dependencies
- **`larrybot/utils/datetime_utils.py`** - Advanced timezone-aware utilities
- **`larrybot/core/timezone.py`** - Timezone service for conversions and detection

### **Key Principles**
- **UTC Storage**: All datetimes are stored in UTC in the database for consistency
- **Local Display**: All times shown to users are converted to local timezone
- **Timezone Awareness**: All datetime operations use timezone-aware utilities
- **No Naive Datetimes**: Direct `datetime.now()`/`datetime.utcnow()` usage is prohibited

### **Best Practices**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use timezone-aware utilities
from larrybot.utils.basic_datetime import get_utc_now, get_current_datetime
from larrybot.utils.datetime_utils import format_datetime_for_display

# For database storage (UTC)
created_at = get_utc_now()

# For user display (local timezone)
display_time = format_datetime_for_display(get_current_datetime())

# ❌ INCORRECT: Direct datetime usage
import datetime
created_at = datetime.utcnow()  # Banned - causes timezone issues
```

### **Migration from Legacy Code**
If you have existing code using direct datetime functions, replace them:

| Old Pattern | New Pattern |
|-------------|-------------|
| `datetime.utcnow()` | `get_utc_now()` |
| `datetime.now()` | `get_current_datetime()` |
| `dt.strftime()` | `format_datetime_for_display(dt)` |

### **Testing with Timezone-Aware Datetimes**
```python
# Test utilities now use timezone-aware datetimes
from tests.utils import create_future_datetime, create_past_datetime
from larrybot.utils.basic_datetime import get_current_datetime

# Create test datetimes
future_dt = create_future_datetime(days=1)
past_dt = create_past_datetime(days=1)
current_dt = get_current_datetime()
```

> **Important**: All datetime operations in LarryBot2 are now timezone-safe by design. This prevents common timezone-related bugs and ensures consistent behavior across different environments.
