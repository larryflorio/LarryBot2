# Developer Guide 🛠️

> **Breadcrumbs:** [Home](../../README.md) > Developer Guide

Welcome to the LarryBot2 Developer Guide. This section covers architecture, development practices, and extending the system for developers who want to contribute, customize, or understand the codebase.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

- **Architecture Overview**: System design and component relationships
- **Development Practices**: How to add features and extend functionality
- **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive testing approaches and tools
- **API Reference**: Complete technical documentation
- **Performance Guide**: Optimization techniques and monitoring

## 🏆 Project Quality

### Testing Excellence

> **📊 Current Statistics**: For the latest test metrics, coverage analysis, and detailed testing status, see [Current State](../project/current-state.md).

**Key Achievements**:
- **✅ Comprehensive test suite** with high coverage across all critical functionality
- **✅ Quality assurance** with automated testing infrastructure  
- **✅ Factory system** for consistent test data creation
- **✅ All tests aligned with MarkdownV2/UX formatting**
- **✅ Performance optimizations verified** with test validation
- **✅ Enhanced UX system** with 36 comprehensive UX tests
- **✅ Best practices for updating tests with UX changes**

> **Best Practice:** When bot responses or formatting change, update test assertions to match the new UX. Prefer substring checks and structure over brittle exact matches.

### Code Quality
- **✅ SOLID principles** throughout the codebase
- **✅ Comprehensive documentation** with examples
- **✅ Type hints** and modern Python practices
- **✅ Error handling** and edge case coverage
- **✅ Enhanced UX system** with modern design patterns

## 🎯 Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- **Maintain 75%+ test coverage** for all new code (current: 75%)
- **Follow SOLID principles** and clean code practices
- **Use type hints** and modern Python features
- **Document all public APIs** with examples
- **Implement performance monitoring** for operations >1 second
- **Use bulk operations** for database efficiency

### Testing Requirements
- **Write comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
- **Test both success and failure paths**
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
- **Use descriptive test names** and documentation
- **Testing framework ready**: All dependencies included in requirements.txt

### Testing with Factories
- **Use factory fixtures** for consistent test data creation
- **Store IDs immediately** after factory creation to avoid session detachment
- **Use descriptive parameters** for test clarity
- **Create related objects** when testing relationships
- **Follow factory best practices** documented in the testing guide

### Contribution Guidelines
- **Run full test suite** before submitting changes
- **Update documentation** for new features
- **Follow existing code style** and patterns
- **Add examples** for new commands or features

## 🚀 Getting Started for Developers

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** with virtual environment
- **Git** for version control
- **SQLite** (included with Python)
- **Basic understanding** of Python, Telegram Bot API, and SQLAlchemy

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd LarryBot2

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your bot token and user ID

# Run tests
pytest

# Start development server
python -m larrybot
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
3. **Implement functionality** with type hints
4. **Update documentation** for new features
5. **Run full test suite** before committing
6. **Submit pull request** with clear description

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Testing Tools
- **pytest**: Main testing framework
- **factory_boy**: Test data factories
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking utilities

### Code Quality
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **black**: Code formatting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for quality

### Performance Tools
- **cProfile**: Performance profiling
- **memory_profiler**: Memory usage analysis
- **Custom monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking
