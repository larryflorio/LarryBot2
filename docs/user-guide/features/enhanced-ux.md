LarryBot2's Enhanced UX System delivers a modern, professional user experience with improved visual hierarchy, smart navigation, and comprehensive error recovery.

LarryBot2 features a modern, context-aware user experience:

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Only the most relevant actions are shown at each step. Tap "More Options" to reveal advanced features.
- **Unified Button Builder:** All action buttons are now consistent, visually clear, and context-sensitive.
- **Smart Suggestions:** After key actions (like creating or completing a task), the bot suggests next steps (e.g., add due date, review analytics).
- **Narrative Input:** You can interact with the bot using natural language, not just commands.
- **Seamless Fallback:** If the bot can't confidently interpret your input, it will suggest the most relevant commands and always offer `/help` and `/list`.
