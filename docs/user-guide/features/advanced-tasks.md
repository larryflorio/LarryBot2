Take your task management to the next level with LarryBot2's advanced features. Whether you're managing complex projects, tracking time, or organizing your workflow, these powerful tools help you stay organized and productive.

## üéØ What You Can Do

- **Set priorities** and due dates for better organization
- **Track time** spent on tasks for productivity insights
- **Create subtasks** and dependencies for complex projects
- **Use categories and tags** for flexible organization
- **Get detailed analytics** on your productivity patterns
- **Manage bulk operations** for efficiency

## üìä Task Priorities

### Set Task Priority

Organize your tasks by importance:

```
/priority 123 high
/priority 124 critical
/priority 125 low
```

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical** - Must be done immediately
- **High** - Important and urgent
- **Medium** - Standard priority (default)
- **Low** - Can be done when convenient

### View Tasks by Priority

Focus on what matters most:

```
/tasks priority:high
/tasks priority:critical
```

## üìÖ Due Dates and Deadlines

### Set Due Dates

Keep track of when tasks are due:

```
/due 123 2025-07-15
/due 124 2025-07-10 14:00
```

### View Tasks by Timeline

See what's coming up:

```
/tasks today
/tasks week
/tasks month
/tasks overdue
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Tracking

### Start Time Tracking

Track how long you spend on tasks:

```
/start 123
```

This starts the timer for task #123.

### Stop Time Tracking

Stop tracking when you're done:

```
/stop 123
```

This stops the timer and records the time spent.

### View Time Summary

See how much time you've spent:

```
/time 123
```

This shows total time spent on task #123.

## üè∑Ô∏è Categories and Tags

### Assign Categories

Organize tasks by project or area:

```
/category 123 work
/category 124 personal
/category 125 client-project
```

### Add Tags

Use flexible tags for quick organization:

```
/tags 123 urgent,frontend,bug
/tags 124 meeting,client
```

### Filter by Categories and Tags

Find tasks quickly:

```
/tasks category:work
/tasks tags:urgent
/tasks category:personal tags:health
```

## üîó Subtasks and Dependencies

### Create Subtasks

Break down complex tasks:

```
/subtask 123 "Research competitors"
/subtask 123 "Create wireframes"
/subtask 123 "Design mockups"
```

### Set Dependencies

Define task relationships:

```
/depend 124 123
```

This makes task #124 depend on task #123 (must complete #123 first).

### View Task Structure

See how tasks are connected:

```
/task 123
```

This shows the task with its subtasks and dependencies.
