Keep all your project files organized by attaching them directly to tasks. Whether you're working on design projects, client deliverables, or personal projects, file attachments help you keep everything in one place.

## üéØ What You Can Do

- **Attach project documents** (PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets)
- **Store design files** (images, mockups, screenshots)
- **Keep reference materials** (text files, notes)
- **Organize project assets** (archives, compressed files)
- **Add descriptions** to files for better organization
- **Manage multiple files** per task

## üìã Supported File Types

### Documents
- **PDF** (`.pdf`) - Reports, contracts, specifications
- **Word Documents** (`.doc`, `.docx`) - Proposals, documentation
- **Text Files** (`.txt`) - Notes, instructions, logs

### Images
- **JPEG** (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) - Photos, screenshots
- **PNG** (`.png`) - Graphics, mockups, diagrams
- **GIF** (`.gif`) - Animated graphics, demos

### Archives
- **ZIP** (`.zip`) - Compressed project files
- **RAR** (`.rar`) - Compressed archives

## üìè File Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 10MB per file
- **Storage**: Files are stored securely on your system
- **Security**: Files are protected with secure naming

## üìé Attaching Files

### Basic File Attachment

Attach a file to a task:

1. **Send the file** to your bot (document, image, etc.)
2. **Reply with the command**:
   ```
   /attach 123
   ```

This attaches the file to task #123.

### Adding Descriptions

Include a description for better organization:

```
/attach 123 "Project requirements document"
/attach 124 "Design mockup v2"
/attach 125 "Client feedback notes"
```

### Multiple Files

You can attach multiple files to the same task:

1. Send first file ‚Üí `/attach 123 "Requirements"`
2. Send second file ‚Üí `/attach 123 "Design mockup"`
3. Send third file ‚Üí `/attach 123 "Meeting notes"`

## üìã Managing Attachments

### View Task Attachments

See all files attached to a task:

```
/attachments 123
```

This shows:
- **File names** and types
- **File sizes** and dates
- **Descriptions** (if added)
- **Attachment IDs** for management

### Update File Descriptions

Change the description of an attachment:

```
/attachment_description 5 "Updated project requirements v2"
/attachment_description 6 "Final design mockup"
```

### Remove Attachments

Delete files you no longer need:

```
/remove_attachment 5
/remove_attachment 6
```

## üéØ Pro Tips

### File Organization

**Use descriptive names:**
```
/attach 123 "Q1_2025_Project_Requirements.pdf"
/attach 124 "Homepage_Design_Mockup_v2.png"
/attach 125 "Client_Meeting_Notes_2025-07-02.txt"
```

**Add helpful descriptions:**
```
/attach 123 "Project requirements document"
/attach 124 "Design mockup for homepage redesign"
/attach 125 "Meeting notes from client discussion"
```

### Project Management

**Organize by project phase:**
```
# Planning phase
/attach 123 "Requirements_Document.pdf"
/attach 123 "Project_Timeline.xlsx"

# Design phase
/attach 124 "Wireframes.png"
/attach 124 "Design_Specs.pdf"

# Development phase
/attach 125 "Code_Review_Notes.txt"
/attach 125 "Test_Results.pdf"
```

**Client project organization:**
```
/attach 123 "Client_Acme_Requirements.pdf"
/attach 123 "Acme_Project_Proposal.docx"
/attach 123 "Acme_Design_Mockups.zip"
```

### File Management

**Regular cleanup:**
- Remove outdated files
- Update descriptions as projects evolve
- Keep only relevant attachments

**Backup important files:**
- Don't rely solely on attachments for critical documents
- Keep local copies of important files
- Use attachments for convenience, not as primary storage

```

### Organization

**Group related files:**
- Attach multiple files to the same task
