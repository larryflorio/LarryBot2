- **Local Display**: Analytics, time tracking, and report periods are always shown in your local time.
- **UTC Storage**: All times are stored in UTC in the database.
- **Manual Override**: Use `/timezone` to set your timezone, or `/autotimezone` to reset to automatic detection.
- **DST Support**: DST changes are handled automatically.
- **Fallback**: If timezone detection fails, UTC is used as a safe default.

> **Tip:** If your analytics or time tracking data appears off, check your timezone setting with `/timezone`.
