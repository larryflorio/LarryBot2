# Bulk Operations ♻️

> **New in v2:** All bulk operation commands now use rich MarkdownV2 formatting, emoji, and interactive inline keyboards for confirmation and navigation. Error and success messages are visually distinct and actionable.

LarryBot2's bulk operations allow you to efficiently manage multiple tasks simultaneously. These commands are perfect for project milestones, status updates, and mass task management.

## 🎯 Overview

Bulk operations enable you to:
- Update multiple tasks at once
- Save time on repetitive tasks
- Maintain consistency across related tasks
- Handle project milestones efficiently

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Before Bulk Operations
1. **Verify Task IDs**: Double-check task IDs before executing
2. **Review Impact**: Consider the impact on related tasks
3. **Backup Important Data**: Ensure important information is preserved
4. **Test with Small Sets**: Start with 2-3 tasks to verify the operation

### During Bulk Operations
1. **Use Confirmation**: Always use confirmation for destructive operations
2. **Monitor Results**: Check the response for successful updates
3. **Handle Errors**: Address any failed operations individually
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what was changed

### After Bulk Operations
1. **Verify Results**: Check that all tasks were updated correctly
2. **Update Related Items**: Update any dependent tasks or projects
3. **Communicate Changes**: Inform team members of bulk updates
4. **Review Analytics**: Check how bulk changes affect your metrics

## 📊 Common Workflows

### Project Phase Transition
```
# Move all tasks in a phase to "In Progress"
/bulk_status 15,16,17,18,19 In Progress

# Set appropriate priorities for the phase
/bulk_priority 15,16,17,18,19 High

# Assign to the project client
/bulk_assign 15,16,17,18,19 ProjectClient
```

### Sprint Cleanup
```
# Mark all completed tasks as "Done"
/bulk_status 25,26,27,28,29 Done

# Archive old completed tasks
/bulk_delete 30,31,32,33,34 confirm
```

### Client Project Setup
```
# Create new tasks for client project
/addtask "Design homepage" High 2025-07-15 design
/addtask "Implement backend" High 2025-07-20 development
/addtask "Write documentation" Medium 2025-07-25 docs

# Assign all to the client
/bulk_assign 35,36,37 NewClient
```

### Priority Escalation
```
# Escalate all tasks in critical project
/bulk_priority 40,41,42,43,44 Critical

# Update status to reflect urgency
/bulk_status 40,41,42,43,44 In Progress
```

## ⚠️ Safety Features

### Confirmation Required
- Bulk delete operations require explicit confirmation
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Allows time to reconsider the action

### Error Handling
- Individual task failures don't stop the entire operation
- Failed tasks are reported in the response
- Allows for manual correction of specific issues

### Validation
- All task IDs are validated before processing
- Invalid IDs are reported but don't stop valid operations
- Parameter validation prevents invalid updates

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Task Not Found**
```
❌ Some tasks not found: #999, #1000
✅ Successfully updated 3 tasks
```
*Solution*: Verify task IDs exist before bulk operations

**Invalid Status/Priority**
```
❌ Invalid status: 'invalid_status'
✅ Successfully updated 2 tasks
```
*Solution*: Use correct status/priority values

**Client Not Found**
```
❌ Client 'UnknownClient' not found
✅ Successfully assigned 2 tasks
```
*Solution*: Verify client name exists

### Error Recovery
1. **Check Failed Tasks**: Review which tasks failed
2. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure correct syntax and values
3. **Handle Individually**: Process failed tasks one by one
4. **Retry Operation**: Attempt the bulk operation again

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Large Operations
- Bulk operations are optimized for efficiency
- Recommended limit: 50 tasks per operation
- Larger operations may take longer to process

### Database Impact
- Bulk operations use optimized database queries
- Reduced database load compared to individual updates
- Transaction-based for data consistency

### Response Time
- Typical response time: 1-3 seconds
- Depends on number of tasks and operation type
- Progress feedback for long operations

## 🎯 Advanced Tips

### Combining with Filtering
```
# Get task IDs for filtering
/tasks In Progress High

# Use those IDs in bulk operation
/bulk_status 1,2,3,4,5 Done
```

### Scripting Bulk Operations
```
# Morning routine: Start tracking high-priority tasks
/bulk_status 10,11,12,13,14 In Progress

# End of day: Mark completed tasks
/bulk_status 15,16,17 Done
```

### Project Management
```
# Sprint planning: Set priorities
/bulk_priority 20,21,22,23,24 High

# Sprint start: Update status
/bulk_status 20,21,22,23,24 In Progress

# Sprint end: Mark completion
/bulk_status 20,21,22,23,24 Done
```
